**Matrix of 1- and 2-dimensional marginalizations of the posterior samples obtained for the adjustable
parameters associated with the compartmental model for each of 280 MSAs.** Inferences are based on daily
reports of new cases of COVID-19 from 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020. Plots of marginal posteriors (1-
dimensional marginalizations) are shown on the diagonal from top left to bottom right. Other plots are 2-
dimensional marginalizations (presented as histograms), which indicate correlations between parameter estimates.
Brightness indicates higher probability density. A compact bright area indicates relatively low correlation. An
extended, asymmetric bright area indicates relatively high correlation. The pairs plots shown here are matched to the
log-likelihood trace plots and parameter trace plots. See the caption of the log-likelihood trace plots for additional
details.
